 A Renetrant lock has the same basic behavior as we have seen for sync blokcs (with some extended feeature)

 ..we can make a lock fair : prevent thread starvation
 sync blocks are unfair by default
 .. we can check whether the given lock is held or not with reenrtrant lock
 ..we can get the list of thereads waiting for the given lock with renetrant locks
 ..synch blocks are nices: we do not need the try-catch-finally block





 ///volatile


 every thread has their own stacck memory with cpu1 and with cache alse

 every read of a volatile voriable will be read from the RAM so from the main
 memroy(not from cache)
 usually variable are cached for performance reasons
 caches are faster. Do not use volatile keyword if not necessary (+ it prevents instruction
 reorderin which is a performance boost technique)
